/**
 * Order matters
 * Ex.
 * addObject(a);
 * addObject(b);
 * trying to click on object a doesnt work due to it being put down first
 * so object b masks the position of object a
 * thus object a gets hidden behind object b
 * unable to access object a
 * Solve: switch order of addition/ if next to each other & is a text & image, reduce text clickable box/image
