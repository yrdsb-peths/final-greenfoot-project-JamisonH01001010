 * adding ways to complete achievements (all)
 * options menu - SFX option on to the setMUSICANDSFX method
 * gamefont too big covering everything?
 * 
 * Q's:
 * title screen -> achievement world white screen
 * achievement home button not working
 * stage select home button not working
 * multiple level icons, possible in one actor subclass or must be in seperate subclasses?

 * ORDER MATTERS??
 * Ex.
 * addObject(a);
 * addObject(b);
 * trying to click on object a doesnt work due to it being put down first
 * so object b masks the position of object a
 * thus object a gets hidden behind object b
 * unable to access object a
