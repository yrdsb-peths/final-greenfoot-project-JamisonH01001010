# Final Greenfoot Project

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>This is a project about a turn based game called Lost Sword with a mini storyline, hidden achievements, upgradeable stats, and 5 stages in total. </p>
<h3>Story:</h3>
<p>Your sword has been stolen by a boss executioner and now you need to retrieve it by going to the monster's dungeon.</p>
<p>Note: There are music and sound effects, be careful of your volume [Music can be turned off, but not sound effects]</p>
<p>Note 2: Resetting the game is not recommended because the sounds will bug and keep resetting, causing the game to freeze and throw an error | If this happens, hop into any of the worlds/actor subclasses and delete a character and add it back, making the game reset the sounds fully and the game will reset properly </p>

<p>Enemies include: Skeleton, Goblin, Wizard, Fire Knight, Undead Executioner.
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<p>Turn Based: User will always go first, doing either an attack, shield, or stun action. After one of those actions are completed, the enemy will get to do an action. This will vary depending on the enemy and will be unknown to the user until encountering it. Enemy skill descriptions and stats are not provided.</p>
<p>A stage will end when either the user or enemy reaches an HP of 0, indicated by the healthbar above them.</p>
<p>User can grind for higher stats by repeating stages for tokens, and this is how the game should be played as every stage the enemy's stats (HP and ATK) will increase.</p>
