Ideas:
RPG game:
Story:
- Boss monster stole the main characters sword, main character now tries to retrieve it (opening scene? with some dialogue?)
- Game name: The Lost Sword

Ideal User Experiece Pathway:
- Difficulty level between each stage should be overcome by 1-2 repeats of prev. stage, even with most optimal user play?
   - Ex. Stage 1-2 [2 upgrades], Stage 2-3 [3 upgrades], Stage 3-4 [4 upgrades], Stage 4-5 [5+ upgrades, ideally more due to "boss" difficulty]
- User can grind for higher stats by repeating stages for tokens
- Upon game completion: End screen (TBD, something like an animation of getting the sword back after defeating the final boss)
- Make game replayable and let user have the retrieved sword to use as gameplay, also if they want to try and find hidden achievements

Intro: [add different music at different timing, also sfx]
- User walking in the forest, then boss comes out to the screen (If suitable boss animation) 
- Something about admiring the user's sword (animation of sword is movement up and down timed along with user no sword animation);
- User senses hostile intention, attacks boss
- Boss defends and attacks user, making him drop the sword on the ground
- Boss grabs the sword (animation of sword going towards boss, add boss animation if possible?)
- Boss says something about visiting the boss at his dungeon and coming to retrieve the sword
- User says something about him going to use his spare sword (one included in animation)
- Intro [END], Goes into tutorial screen

- Stage selection:
   - 5 Stages, each with their own world
