Ideal User Experiece Pathway:
- Difficulty level between each stage should be overcome by 1-2 repeats of prev. stage, even with most optimal user play?
   - Ex. Stage 1-2 [2 upgrades], Stage 2-3 [3 upgrades], Stage 3-4 [4 upgrades], Stage 4-5 [5+ upgrades, ideally more due to "boss" difficulty]
- User can grind for higher stats by repeating stages for tokens
- Upon game completion: End screen (TBD)
