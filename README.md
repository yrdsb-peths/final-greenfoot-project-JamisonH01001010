Ideas:
RPG game:
Story:
- Boss monster stole the main characters sword, main character now tries to retrieve it (opening scene? with some dialogue?)
- Game name: The Lost Sword

Ideal User Experiece Pathway:
- Difficulty level between each stage should be overcome by 1-2 repeats of prev. stage, even with most optimal user play?
   - Ex. Stage 1-2 [2 upgrades], Stage 2-3 [3 upgrades], Stage 3-4 [4 upgrades], Stage 4-5 [5+ upgrades, ideally more due to "boss" difficulty]
- User can grind for higher stats by repeating stages for tokens
- Upon game completion: End screen (TBD, something like an animation of getting the sword back after defeating the final boss)
- Make game replayable and let user have the retrieved sword to use as gameplay, also if they want to try and find hidden achievements

Note: When user loses, no constellation rewards

- Stage 1:
   - Player vs. (TBD)
   - Reward: 10 Tokens
- Stage 2:
   - Player vs. (TBD)
   - Reward: 15 Tokens
- Stage 3:
